<p> <b> Docker </b> Using Docker Postgre Image for local Database

<p> <b> tsconfig.json </b> For configuring the Typescript files

<p> <b> SRC setup </b> As for now I have increase one empty controller folder for logic, one routes folder for defining routes and one app.ts for entry point for application
